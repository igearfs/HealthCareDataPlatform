# **WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL SETUP - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** 


This is for all who live on this planet to think aoubt why we are sick from our food? What are we eating? Dies? Chemicals instead of real ingreedents?
What do these things do to our bodies to produce ill effects? This app should help health care workers actually find the root cause of the patient issues.

Could even be what's in your DNA. 

This field is so wide open and an amazing Quest! How to be healthy!  

See the information below on water and the whole plant life cycle and what we eat to what's in the air.
Mental issues? Stress? All of these things affect your health! 

It's time to uncover these things and become healthier. Like the Bobby App! I would love to bring that into this for what people eat and what that food does to you.

** Example:

 - Excerpt on Red Dye Issues

 - Red food dyes, particularly Red Dye No. 3 (Erythrosine) and Red Dye No. 40 (Allura Red AC), have been the subject of health concerns due to potential links to allergic reactions, hyperactivity in children, and possible carcinogenic effects.

    Health Risks: Studies have suggested that synthetic red dyes may contribute to behavioral issues such as ADHD symptoms in children. Additionally, Red Dye No. 3 has been linked to thyroid tumors in animal studies, leading to its ban in cosmetics but continued use in food.

    Regulatory Status: While the FDA permits the use of certain red dyes in food, some countries—such as the European Union—require warning labels or have banned specific artificial colorants.

    Common Sources: These dyes are frequently found in candies, soft drinks, processed snacks, and medications.

 - Growing consumer concern has driven demand for natural alternatives, like beet juice and paprika extracts, in food products.

# Healthcare Data Platform
Sponsored by: In-Game Event, A Red Flag Syndicate LLC

## Core Concept
- Should we adopt a distributed central location, decentralized model, or both?
- All data could reside with individuals and apps, giving users the choice to opt in or out.
  - Opting in would upload data to the central Health Data Platform.
  - Opting out would remove data from the central system.
- Data requests could be approved live within the app, eliminating the constant need to opt out.  
  **It's time to disrupt the healthcare industry.**
- **Data Pipelines for all forms of data inbound. HL7, CCD, Fhir, Genetics, Labs, X12, etc...**
- Data analytics to watch over the persons health and potentially the world's health. 
- Use AI to scan and interpret documents to pull in patient data from doctors notes.
- Create format/standard for scanning in documents that all providers can use.
- Use programming means AI/code to read in documents and create HL7
- USe HL7 to JSON converters for FHIR
- Read in SDOH data.

# Pipelines we would like to include starting with HL7, X12 more data more the docs can see the big picture on a patient.

This project supports a variety of patient-level data pipelines across healthcare and dental domains. Below is a breakdown of supported pipelines:

## General Healthcare Pipelines
- **Electronic Health Record (EHR) Pipelines**: Capture patient demographics, medical history, diagnoses, medications, and treatment plans.
- **Imaging Data Pipelines**: Process and store patient imaging data such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans using systems like PACS.
- **Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) Pipelines**: Handle patient-specific lab orders, results, and analyses (e.g., blood tests, biopsies).
- **Pharmacy Data Pipelines**: Track prescriptions, medication adherence, and patient-specific pharmacy records.
- **Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) Pipelines**: Collect real-time patient data from wearable devices and sensors, such as heart rate and glucose levels.
- **Telehealth Data Pipelines**: Transmit patient data from virtual consultations, including clinical notes and vitals.

### **Enhanced Objective: Environment and Eating Habits**
We aim to identify harmful chemicals in food and their impact on long-term health, factoring in:

- **Toxins in Processed Foods:** Highlight ingredients with links to chronic conditions.
- **Pesticides and Herbicides:** Analyze their presence in fruits, vegetables, and grains.
- **Soil and Crop Conditions:** Investigate soil nutrient depletion and its effect on food quality.
- **Cumulative Impact of Diet and Environment:** Cross-reference eating habits with local environmental data to provide holistic health recommendations.

### **Brainstorming Thoughts**
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Kafka for event streaming and plug-and-play systems.
- **Data Pipelining:** Airflow for programmable data pipelines.
- **Caching and Querying:**
  - Redis for caching.
  - GraphQL for FHIR integration.
- **Database Choices:**
  - Postgres with Citus for distributed databases (to handle massive data and maintain speed).
  - Alternatively, Cassandra for scalability, though Postgres may serve personal and centralized use better.
- **App Structure:**
  - Option for personal apps with standalone Postgres instances.
  - Personal data can connect or disconnect from the main server with full data removal on disconnection.
  - Fully decentralized option: peer-to-peer data sharing (would complicate reporting but ensures complete decentralization).
- **Consent Management:**
  - Full transparency on data sharing.
  - Users will receive notifications for new data sharing opportunities (e.g., insurance company onboarding).
  - Always opt-in, never automatic.
- **Doctor rating and Review Section:**
  - Patients can rate the doctor/dentist/healthcare provider
